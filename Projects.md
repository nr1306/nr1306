**Project -4 AWS-Event-Driven-Compliance-Automation**

https://github.com/nr1306/AWS-Event-Driven-Compliance-Automation

Description: Developed an automated policy enforcement system across AWS services by building event-driven Lambda functions triggered via EventBridge, reducing manual compliance checks by 70% and ensuring consistent governance over EBS, EC2, and S3 resources. Utilized Python and boto3 within IAM-secured Lambda functions to automatically convert EBS volumes, audit S3 buckets, and validate EC2 instance types against organizational standards. Replaced manual monitoring with a scalable automation framework, cutting cloud operations overhead by 60% through least-privilege IAM roles, centralized CloudWatch logging, and robust event-driven workflows.

One project I’m especially proud of is the **AWS Cloud Compliance Automation Platform** 
Resume(n).

The core problem I wanted to solve was simple but painful: teams were manually checking whether AWS resources were configured correctly. That process was slow, error-prone, and easy to forget under pressure. I built a system that continuously evaluated the state of AWS resources in real time and automatically corrected non-compliant configurations.

I designed serverless detection and remediation workflows using AWS CDK, Lambda, and EventBridge. The platform monitored EC2, S3, and other resources, enforced IAM guardrails, and triggered automated fixes whenever configurations drifted from defined policies. This reduced configuration drift by 40% and cut manual review effort by 70%.

What I’m most proud of isn’t just the metrics — it’s that I owned the project end to end. I defined the architecture, implemented the automation logic, handled deployment, and ensured it was reliable. It forced me to think about scalability, security, and failure handling, not just “does the code run.” It also changed how I think about systems: good engineering removes repetitive human work and replaces it with reliable, observable automation.

Resume Points:

- Automated policy enforcement across AWS services by developing Lambda functions triggered via EventBridge, reducing manual compliance checks by 70% and ensuring consistent governance over EBS, EC2, and S3.
- Optimized cloud resource governance by using Python and boto3 within IAM-secured Lambda functions to auto-convert EBS volumes, audit S3 buckets, and validate EC2 instance types based on organizational standards.
- Reduced cloud operations overhead by 60% by replacing manual monitoring with scalable, event-driven automation, secured through least-privilege IAM roles and integrated with centralized CloudWatch logging.

**Project-5 Automated DynamoDB Data Visualization Using AWS Services**

Achieved **real-time dashboard visualization** by integrating Athena with **Amazon QuickSight**, implementing **IAM role policies** to securely enable Lambda execution and manage controlled access to **S3 spill buckets** for efficient handling of large queries.

Resume Points:

- Enabled SQL querying on NoSQL data by connecting DynamoDB to Athena through an AWS Lambda data connector and configuring AWS Glue crawlers, allowing seamless access and query execution over structured metadata.
- Achieved real-time dashboard visualization by integrating Athena with Amazon QuickSight, using IAM role policies to securely enable Lambda execution and grant controlled access to S3 spill buckets for large query handling.

**Project -7 Gradient Boosting model**

https://github.com/nr1306/ML_Project2
Description: Developed a **Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT) model** from scratch with a familiar `fit`–`predict` interface following Sections 10.9–10.10 of *Elements of Statistical Learning (2nd Edition)*. The model supports regression using various loss functions—squared error, absolute error, and Huber loss—with tunable hyperparameters including `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, `max_depth`, and `loss`. Using the California Housing dataset, the team validated performance via Mean Squared Error (MSE) and analyzed feature importance for interpretability. The project, carried out collaboratively by “Tree Titans” (Nesh and Nikhil), highlights both core development of the algorithm and enhancements like hyperparameter tuning and visualization.

Resume Points:

Project -8 

https://github.com/nr1306/Project1_ML

Description: Developed a **Linear Regression with ElasticNet regularization** model—a blend of L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) techniques—to enable more robust, interpretable regression on datasets with multicollinearity or the need for feature selection. The project includes synthetic data generation, a clean `fit`–`predict` interface, and configuration via key hyperparameters like `alpha` (regularization strength) and `l1_ratio` (mixing ratio). It’s well-suited for regression tasks where both prediction accuracy and model sparsity are important.

Resume Points:

**Project -9 Home Automation Dashboard**

https://github.com/20IT121/Homemade_Automation-Dashboard

Description: Delivered a **production-ready IoT-based home automation system** with end-to-end integration of **ESP32 microcontrollers** and **DS18B20 sensors** into a responsive **Qt Quick dashboard**, built using **QML** for the frontend and **C++** for backend logic.
